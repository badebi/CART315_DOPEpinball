## Playtest #1 - prototyping a new mechanic
My initial idea for a new mechanic was the fact that I wanted to create a new experience in pinball; a sort of experience which one can not acheive in playing arcade version of PinBall and it is only possible digitally; that was the moment when the idea of having POV camera on the ball and controlling it came into my mind.
For the first playtest, I started from the basic pinball that we made in the class and added the second camera and a script to control the ball. Basically, when the "multiplier" reaches a threahold, player could press SPACE to enter the POV mode and controls the ball for a limited time. Then camera would return to its initial position and the player could not control the ball anymore.
Based on the playtesters' feedback, here are some aspects of my game which needed to work on:
* Too many controls made the game too difficult to play.
* The ability of rotating the camera in POV mode was too much and confusing.
* The duration of the POV mode was static and player could not extend it somehow.
* Bumpers were too big compared to the board.
* Nothing was in the UI to help players understand what to do and how to play the game.
* Nothing indicats that the player is able to use its "SUPER POWER", or when it is gonna happen during the game.
