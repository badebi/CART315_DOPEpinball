# DOPE pinball Journal
## Playtest #1 - prototyping a new mechanic
My initial idea for a new mechanic was the fact that I wanted to create a new experience in pinball, a sort of experience that one can not acheive in playing arcade PinBall and it is only possible digitally; that was when the idea of having POV camera on the ball and controlling it came into my mind.


## Playtest #2 - alpha test


## Playtest #3 - beta test


## The Final Game
